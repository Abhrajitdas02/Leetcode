## About

This repository is a collection of my solutions to coding challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). Practicing coding problems helps improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking, which are valuable for technical interviews and real-world programming challenges.

## Languages

I've provided solutions in the following programming languages:

- Python
- Java
- C++

Feel free to choose the language you're most comfortable with.

## Platforms

### LeetCode

The [LeetCode](/leetcode) folder contains solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic. Each solution includes the problem statement, code, and explanations if necessary.

### GeeksforGeeks (GFG)

The [GeeksforGeeks](/gfg) folder contains solutions to GeeksforGeeks problems, categorized by their respective topics. Just like in the LeetCode section, each solution is accompanied by explanations.

## How to Use

1. Browse the [LeetCode](/leetcode) and [GeeksforGeeks](/gfg) folders to find problems categorized by topics.
2. Each problem solution includes the problem statement, code, and explanations.
3. You're welcome to use the code for your own learning or even as a reference for your own submissions.
4. If you're new to coding challenges, start with easier problems and gradually move to more complex ones.

## Contributing

Contributions are appreciated! If you'd like to contribute your solutions or improvements, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`
3. Add your solution in the appropriate folder.
4. Include clear explanations in your code or in a separate README within the problem folder.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add solution for Problem XYZ'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`
7. Open a pull request, and I'll review it as soon as possible.
